## Guest UX Flow

1. **Landing page** — email input
   - Unknown → waitlist popup
   - Waitlisted → "you're on the waitlist"
   - Denied → same as unknown (no indication of denial); re-submitting resets to waitlisted
   - Admin email → password field → admin session
   - Approved + incomplete profile → profile completion (first name, last name, phone)
   - Approved + complete → home page

2. **Home page** — upcoming published event: date/time, location, price, seats remaining, menu image, cancellation policy, theming. Party size selector (capped at `min(4, remaining)`). "Sold out" when full. Link to past events.

3. **Guest info** — primary contact pre-filled; additional guests with name + dietary restrictions.

4. **Stripe Checkout** — `allow_promotion_codes: true`. Webhook marks reservation `paid + reserved` → fires confirmation email. Abandoned `pending` reservations deleted after 30 min.

5. **Confirmation screen** — reservation summary, confirmation number, manage reservation link.

6. **Manage reservation** — cancel (shows cancellation policy; no auto-refund). Party size changes require cancel + rebook. Cancellations locked within 72h of event.

7. **Past events** — read-only list of completed events.

## Emails (Resend)

| Trigger | Email |
|---|---|
| Admin approves waitlisted user | Approval — "You're on the list" + site link |
| Stripe webhook (payment complete) | Confirmation — event details, amount paid, confirmation number, manage link |
| 24h before event (cron, `reminder_sent_at IS NULL`) | Reminder — "See you tomorrow", event details |
| Guest cancels | Cancellation — confirms cancellation, manual refund note |
| Admin cancels event | Event cancellation — apology, manual refund note |

Cron: hourly GET `/api/cron/send-emails` (Bearer `CRON_SECRET`). Returns `{ ok, sent24h }`.

## Admin UX

- **Dashboard** — pending approvals (approve/deny), current event: reservation count + revenue
- **Guest list** — all users with status; approve/deny actions
- **Events** — list all events; create/edit (title, description, date, location, price, total seats, menu image, cancellation policy, theme colors + header image); publish/unpublish/cancel; one published event at a time enforced
- **Reservations** — table: guest, email, party size, payment status, reservation status, amount; actions: cancel, no-show, refund, resend confirmation, resend reminder

---

## Development Phases

### Phase 1 — Foundation ✅
Next.js 14 + Prisma + PostgreSQL, schema + migration, NextAuth admin auth, iron-session, TDD for `generateConfirmationNumber`, all route stubs.

### Phase 2 — Guest Flow ✅
Full guest booking flow: landing page (email gate), profile completion, home page with event + theming, guest info, Stripe Checkout, webhook, confirmation screen, manage reservation (cancel), past events, guest nav.

### Phase 3 — Emails ✅
Resend integration. All transactional emails: approval, confirmation, 24h reminder, cancellation, event cancellation. Hourly cron route.

### Phase 4 — Admin Panel ✅
Admin auth guard, nav, profile. Dashboard (approvals + event snapshot). Guest list (approve/deny). Event CRUD + publish/unpublish/cancel. Reservations table (cancel, no-show, refund, resend). Public `GET /api/events` endpoint.

### Phase 5 — Deployment ✅
- Neon: provision, `npx prisma migrate deploy`
- S3: bucket + CORS for presigned uploads
- Amplify: connect repo, all env vars persisted via `.env.production` in build
- Stripe: production webhook
- Resend: verify sending domain, add API key to Amplify env vars
- Smoke test: end-to-end booking + email delivery

### Phase 6 — UI / Styling
Guest-facing (clean, sleek — primary user experience):
- Landing page: email gate, waitlist/approval states
- Home page: event card with theming (`theme_bg_color`, `theme_accent_color`, `theme_header_image_url`), party size selector
- Booking flow: guest info form, Stripe handoff
- Confirmation screen + manage reservation page
- Past events list
- Consistent typography, spacing, mobile-first responsive layout
- Profile page

Admin-facing (clean, sleek, functional — internal use only):
- Dashboard, guest list, events, profile

### Phase 7 — Polish
- Loading states + error boundaries
- Cleanup job: delete `pending` reservations older than 30 min
- Auto-complete cron: move `published` → `completed` after event date passes
